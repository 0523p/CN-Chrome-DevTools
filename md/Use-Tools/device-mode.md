# Device Mode & Mobile Emulation

https://developer.chrome.com/devtools/docs/device-mode

As your mobile audience grows, responsive mobile-friendly web design becomes all the more important. Web content needs to look and feel great across a wide variety of devices and network conditions. But testing the quality of your mobile experiences takes longer and makes debugging more complex.

Device mode brings the insights of mobile testing to your browser tab through the power of mobile emulation.

You can use device mode to:

* Test your responsive designs by emulating different screen sizes and resolutions, including Retina displays.
* Evaluate your site's performance using the network emulator, without affecting traffic to other tabs.
* Visualize and inspect CSS media queries.
* Accurately simulate device input for touch events, geolocation, and device orientation.
* Enhance your current debugging workflow by combining device mode with the existing DevTools.

**Note**: Some of this documentation might be ahead of the stable version of Chrome. If you are unable to locate a feature, try using [Chrome Canary](https://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/browser/canary.html), which contains the latest version of the DevTools.
